## Sense
I created this project to demonstrate the power of **child view controllers** in iOS development. But in order to avoid boring and simple interfaces in this concept, I was using interactive views and custom transitions üòé
Please check attached video below, demonstrating how it works.

* This project contains only pure Swift‚ù§Ô∏è
* No third-party frameworks and Pods.

## Presentation

</p>

### Key things:

1. `UIPanGestureRecognizer` for dragging cards.
2. `CADisplayLink` for accurate observing of frames changes in animations.
3. `UIView.animate{}` blocks for most of the animations.
4. `CABasicAnimation` for shadow layer.
5. `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate` for custom transition to Details scene.
6. All UI is made **programmatically**, thus it‚Äôs reusable. No xibs, no storyboards.

### Structure of the screen

</p>

Here is a structure of main screen.<br/>
ProfileViewController - as a parent view controller, subclassed from `CardsHolderViewController`. It contains such child view controllers:<br/>

1. ProfileShortInfoViewController (top part of the screen)
2. ProfileActivityViewController (activity card)
3. RecommendationsViewController (recommended card)

</p>

If you open recommended card, there will be such state for the screen:<br/>
Fully visible RecommendationsViewController, that contains tableView with cells, each of which holds child view controller subclassed from `RecommendationsSliderViewController`.
